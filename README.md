# ComPy

This package contains many functions that I commonly use in my work and studies.
It's usually to speed up work that I do in interactive environments rather than
for use in production code.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/tilleyd/compy
cd compy
python3 setup.py install
```

## Usage

The package contains a whole range of functions. The package is separated into
modules that work with specific types of data or produce specific outcomes,
e.g. `compy.image` to work with images and `compy.plot` to produce common plots.

If you are interested in using this library, have a look through the package.
It's mainly for personal use, so I'm not going to write a tutorial or anything.
